| Model        | Models contain a large number of parameters and are trained on vast amounts of diverse data. You can use models to perform various tasks such as image generation, question answering, code generation, rewriting, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Access Token | When calling Magic API and SDK, access tokens are required to verify user identity and authorize access. Users can set different permissions for each access token to achieve secure resource access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Token        | In large language models, tokens are the basic units of text processing. Models typically break down input text into a series of tokens, then process and analyze these tokens. Tokens can be words, characters, subword segments, or other forms of text fragments. The specific segmentation method depends on the tokenization algorithm used by the model, so token calculation and processing methods may vary according to the model's specific architecture and design. When conversing with an AI assistant, the generated tokens are the sum of input tokens and output tokens. |
| Prompt       | Natural language instructions that tell the model what task to perform. For example, "Translate the text into English".<br>It is recommended to specify the model's role in the persona and response logic, design the response language style, and limit the model's answer scope to make conversations more aligned with user expectations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Workflow     | A workflow is a tool used for planning and implementing complex functional logic. You can design complex multi-step tasks by dragging different task nodes, improving construction efficiency in complex business scenarios.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Knowledge    | Knowledge base is the AI assistant's private knowledge collection, used to store professional domain knowledge data, solving the problem of insufficient professional domain knowledge in general large models, and improving the professionalism and accuracy of AI assistant responses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Memory       | Memory refers to the ability of artificial intelligence to store, retrieve, and utilize information over time, improving model performance by providing more accurate and contextually relevant responses.<br>Magic provides a set of memory functions, including variables, databases, and long-term memory, to meet different use cases. Based on these memories, personalized responses can be provided to enhance user experience.                                                                                                                                                   |
